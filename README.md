# <b>Project One: Interactive History Sniffing: CAPTCHA </b><br />

<ins><b>Introduciton</ins></b><br />
This project is simulated to experience Web Security vulnerabilities using a CAPTCHA system to detect a user's recent browsing activity and offer tailored recommendations based on their interests. Assuming the user is a college student, my program serves as an advisor, suggesting various majors in alignment with the user's web history. This simple yet effective project provides invaluable insights into the features of web vulnerabilities and the importance of robust security measures. 

<ins><b> Code Implementation: </ins></b><br />
[Python Code](history.py): The main Python script for detecting web history and generating recommendations. <br />
[HTML Code](question.tpl): The HTML template file used by the program.
